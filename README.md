## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Structure

The dataset follows the **CIFAR-10 class structure**, with **10 categories**:


Each class folder contains **multiple images** belonging to that category.  
- **`train/`** â†’ Used for model training.  
- **`validation/`** â†’ Used for model tuning and hyperparameter optimization.  
- **`test/`** â†’ Used for final model evaluation.  

## ðŸ“¥ Loading the CIFAR-10 Dataset

To load the **CIFAR-10 dataset** directly from **Keras**, use the following code:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import cifar10

# Load CIFAR-10 dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()

# Display dataset shape
print(f"Training Data Shape: {x_train.shape}, Labels: {y_train.shape}")
print(f"Testing Data Shape: {x_test.shape}, Labels: {y_test.shape}")

## ðŸ”„ Normalizing the CIFAR-10 Dataset

---

### **ðŸ”„ Why Normalize?**
CIFAR-10 images have pixel values ranging from **[0, 255]**.  
To improve model efficiency, we **normalize** these values by **scaling them to the [0,1] range**.

âœ… **Benefits of Normalization:**
- **Speeds up training** by ensuring stable weight updates.
- **Improves model accuracy** by keeping pixel values within a small range.
- **Prevents large gradient updates**, which can cause instability in deep learning models.

### **ðŸ“Š Min-Max Check**
After normalization:
- **Minimum pixel value:** `0.0`
- **Maximum pixel value:** `1.0`

This ensures that all input images are properly scaled before training.
